		<h2><i>the chattahoochee valley beats like a heart</i></h2>
		<h4>16 Apr 2024 3:05PM</h4>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;As many are aware at this point, Joshua and I have made the decision to move to Conneticut. He's enrolling in an MFA program at UCONN this fall. I'm quite excited for him, but also for myself. He's needed space and time to make more now than ever. His feet are off the ground with interesting ideas and he seriously needs the facility and time to explore these ideas further. I'm quite proud of him, he is becoming more of himself, and it makes me love him more and more.<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;I am excited for myself because we'll be just a short two hour train ride from NYC. A close friend of mine is moving to Brooklyn this month, and another already lives in Hudson. After our trip back in November, I discovered how important it would be for me to have constant access to the Big Apple.<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;This blog post, the first one, is titled <i>the chattahoochee valley beats like a heart</i> because I'm feeling now, more than ever, how much love is in this community. Joshua-Michéle Ross came to Columbus last week bringing his participatory performance piece titled <i>Séance to Summon A Garden</i>. Much of the audio from this piece is recorded from Columbus and Pasaquan. He sent us the audio recording of our performance just a few moments ago, and I couldn't help but cry again. These sounds epitomize the valley, and Georgia for that matter, in a way that anyone who's lived here for some time would feel the beat of it's heart.<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;Here are the two recordings of the performance where I participated. I was chosen by the Whippoorwill at Pasaquan and the Beautiful Strangers, a.k.a. the goats, at Illges. I hope you enjoy them both.<br>
		<br>Warmly,<br>
		Dalton
